# Hi, I'm David Hinojosa

Currently on my last semester of Computer Science at [Tec de Monterrey](https://tec.mx/es). I like to [code](https://github.com/dhinogz), tinker with my [toolbox](https://neovim.io/), and design intelligent systems. I also enjoy cooking, a nice hike in the mountains, and american football.

# Hi, the name's David Hinojosa

I like to [code](https://github.com/dhinogz), tinker with my [toolbox](github.com/dhinogz/dotfiles), and design intelligent systems. I'm a Computer Science major, a Software Engineer at [Google](https://google.com), was a Technical Support Engineer at [Datadog](https://datadog.com). I also enjoy cooking, a nice hike in the mountains, and american football.

This worked for a while, but could not be sustainable. Reading about the &lt;a href="https://cybernews.com/news/ddos-attack-104k-bill-from-hosting-provider/">Vercel situation&lt;/a> got me thinking I should consider self-hosted alternatives to avoid being vendor locked in and making shipping faster and easier.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>

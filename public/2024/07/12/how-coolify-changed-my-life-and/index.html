  <p>Ever since I first learned about containers in <a href="https://djangoforprofessionals.com/">Django For Professionals</a>, I&rsquo;ve added container orchestration with Docker Compose on all my projects. Even my teammates jokingly started calling me &ldquo;Docker Commander&rdquo;. The thing was, I made them for dev first environments, worrying about deploying them on platforms like <a href="fly.io">fly.io</a> or <a href="https://cloud.google.com/run">Google Cloud Run</a> later. This worked for a while, but could not be sustainable. Reading about the <a href="https://cybernews.com/news/ddos-attack-104k-bill-from-hosting-provider/">Vercel situation</a> got me thinking I should consider self-hosted alternatives to avoid being vendor locked in and making shipping faster and easier.</p>
<h2 id="deploying-docker-compose-on-a-vps">Deploying Docker Compose on a VPS</h2>
<p>This definitly was my first thought and was just how I started out at my first internship. It&rsquo;s pretty simple, add a docker-compose.override.yml file that adds the caddy reverse proxy, and that should be enough to work! This does come with it&rsquo;s drawbacks. I lose various features, like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scaling</li>
<li>Subdomains</li>
<li>Secret management</li>
<li>Easy monitoring</li>
<li>Logs</li>
<li>Simple GUI</li>
</ul>
<p>This works for one project at a time, but when I need to ship fast, cloning various projects into my VPS and managing them would be a pain.</p>
<h2 id="enter-kubernetes">Enter Kubernetes</h2>
<p>Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration system that automates deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It has features like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Automated rollouts and rollbacks</li>
<li>Self-healing capabilities</li>
<li>Horizontal scaling</li>
<li>Service discovery and load balancing</li>
<li>Secret and configuration management</li>
</ul>
<p>This sounds awesome and just what I was looking for! As I was reading the docs and all other type of content, I realized this would be at least a 2-week long project to get right, even though I&rsquo;m pretty comfortable with the command line and always wanted to see what Kubernetes is all about. I needed to ship now and this seemed a bit too complex for my current needs. I&rsquo;ll definitly try it out when I got the time and need the scaling, but for now it was back to the drawing board.</p>
<h2 id="tech-twitter-to-the-rescue">Tech Twitter to the Rescue</h2>
<p>As I mentioned before, the Vercel incident was what made me consider self hosting and Tech Twitter users took the time to layout alternatives to various Next.js beginners stuck on the platform. <a href="https://coolify.io/">Coolify</a> was the most hyped-up open source PaaS, so I decided to check it out. And let me tell you, it was the easiest thing I&rsquo;ve done in a while. I rented out a $15 VPS on Hetzner with the following <a href="https://www.vpsbenchmarks.com/hosters/hetzner/plans/cpx31">stats</a>:</p>
<table>

<tr>
<td>Memory GBs</td>

<td>20,000</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Pretty awesome for the price.</p>
